# Data-Modeling-Project
This is my personal project exploring Monte Carlo simulations on gaining/losing weight.


The function simulate_n_weeks takes in two arguments: the initial weight and the excess calories per day (which can be a negative value, indication calorie deficit).

It then plots the predicted weight gain/loss with a slight randomness factor.
